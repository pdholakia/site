I am working as Business Applications Integration Architect, with experience in multiple middleware stacks such as IBM WebSphere, MuleSoft, Dell Boomi, etc. 

I enjoy exploring and learning about different technologies and hope to own a technology-driven business in the future. 

Currently, I am working on improving my communication skills and hence this blog. You can see from this page that this is not an area where I excel naturally. This is version one of this page though, and hopefully, future edits will have more compelling and interesting facts here. 

So do visit back and thank you for reading.
